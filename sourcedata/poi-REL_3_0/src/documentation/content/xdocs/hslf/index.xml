            <title>Overview</title>

            <p>HSLF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the Powerpoint file format.</p>
            <p>HSSF provides a way to read powerpoint presentations, and extract text from it.
            It also provides some (currently limited) edit capabilities.
            </p>
            <note> 
                This code currently lives the 
                <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/">scratchpad area</link> 
                of the POI SVN repository. 
				Ensure that you have the scratchpad jar or the scratchpad 
                build area in your
				classpath before experimenting with this code.
			</note>
			<p>The <link href="./quick-guide.html">quick guide</link> documentation provides 
            information on using this API. Comments and fixes gratefully accepted on the POI
            dev mailing lists.</p>
