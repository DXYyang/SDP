		<p>HWPF is still in early development. It is in the <link
     	href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/jakarta/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/">
		scratchpad section of the SVN.</link> You will need to ensure you
		either have a recent SVN checkout, or a recent SVN nightly build
		(including the scratchpad jar!)</p>

        <section><title>Basic Text Extraction</title>
        <p>For basic text extraction, make use of 
<code>org.apache.poi.hwpf.extractor.WordExtractor</code>. It accepts an input
stream or a <code>HWPFDocument</code>. The <code>getText()</code> 
method can be used to 
get the text from all the paragraphs, or <code>getParagraphText()</code>
can be used to fetch the text from each paragraph in turn. The other
option is <code>getTextFromPieces()</code>, which is very fast, but
tends to return things that aren't text from the page. YMMV.
		</p>
		</section>
		
		<section><title>Specific Text Extraction</title>
		<p>To get specific bits of text, first create a 
<code>org.apache.poi.hwpf.HWPFDocument</code>. Fetch the range 
with <code>getRange()</code>, then get paragraphs from that. You
can then get text and other properties.
		</p>
		</section>
		
		<section><title>Changing Text</title>
		<p>It is possible to change the text via 
		<code>insertBefore()</code> and <code>insertAfter()</code>
		on a <code>Range</code> object (either a <code>Range</code>,
		<code>Paragraph</code> or <code>CharacterRun</code>).
		It is also possible to delete a <code>Range</code>, but this
		code is know to have bugs in it.
		</p>
		</section>

		<section><title>Further Examples</title>
		<p>For now, the best source of additional examples is in the unit 
		tests. <link
     	href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/jakarta/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/testcases/org/apache/poi/hwpf/">
