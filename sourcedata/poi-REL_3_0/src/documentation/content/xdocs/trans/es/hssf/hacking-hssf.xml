            <p>
                You might find the
                'Excel 97 Developer's Kit' (out of print, Microsoft Press, no
                restrictive covenants, available on Amazon.com) helpful for
                understanding the file format.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also useful is the <link href="http://sc.openoffice.org/excelfileformat.pdf">open office XLS spec</link>.  We
                are collaborating with the maintainer of the spec so if you think you can add something to their
                document just send through your changes.

            <ol>
                <li>
                Look at OpenOffice.org or Gnumeric sources if its implemented there.
                </li>
                <li>
                Use org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.BiffViewer to view the structure of the
                file.  Experiment by adding one criteria entry at a time.  See what it
                does to the structure, infer behavior and structure from it.  Using the
                unix diff command (or get cygwin from www.cygwin.com for windows) you
                can figure out a lot very quickly. Unimplemented records show up as
                'UNKNOWN' and prints a hex dump.

        <section><title>Low-level Record Generation</title>
            <p>
                Low level records can be time consuming to created.  We created a record
                generator to help generate some of the simpler tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                We use XML
                descriptors to generate the Java code (which sure beats the heck out of
                the PERL scripts originally used ;-) for low level records.  The
                generator is kinda alpha-ish right now and could use some enhancement,
                so you may find that to be about 1/2 of the work.  Notice this is in
                org.apache.poi.hssf.record.definitions.
