   <p>The <strong>POI Browser</strong> is a very simple Swing GUI tool that
    displays the internal structure of a Microsoft Office file. It concentrates
    on streams in the <em>Horrible Property Set Format (HPSF)</em>. In order to
    access these streams the POI Browser uses the package
    <tt>org.apache.poi.hpsf</tt>.</p>

   <p>A file in  Microsoft's Office format can be seen as a filesystem within a
    file. For example, a Word document like <var>sample.doc</var> is just a
    simple file from the operation system's point of view. However, internally
    it is organized into various directories and files. For example,
    <var>sample.doc</var> might consist of the three internal files (or
    "streams", as Microsoft calls them) <tt>\001CompObj</tt>,
    <tt>\005SummaryInformation</tt>, and <tt>WordDocument</tt>. (In these names
    \001 and \005 denote the unprintable characters with the character codes 1
    and 5, respectively.) A more complicated Word file typically contains a
    directory named <tt>ObjectPool</tt> with more directories and files nested
    within it.</p>

   <p>The POI Browser makes these internal structures visible. It takes one or
    more Microsoft files as input on the command line and shows directories and
    files in a tree-like structure. On the top-level POI Browser displays the
    (operating system) filenames. An internal file (i.e. a "stream" or a
    "document") is shown with its name, its size and a hexadecimal dump of its
    first bytes.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
   <h3>Property Set Streams</h3>

   <p>The POI Browser pays special attention to property set streams. For
    example, the <tt>\005SummaryInformation</tt> stream  contains information
    like title and author of the document. The POI Browser opens every stream
    in a POI filesystem. If it encounters a property set stream, it displays
    not just its first bytes but analyses the whole stream and displays its
    contents in a more or less readable manner.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
   <h3>Running POI Browser</h3>

   <p>Running the POI Browser requires you to start a Java Virtual Machine
    (JVM) and to set up a valid classpath so that the JVM can find all the Java
    classes it needs. These are the main POI classes and the "contrib" POI
    classes.</p>

   <p>The following instructions assume that you have set up your Java
    enviromnent variables properly, i.e. the variable JAVA_HOME contains the
    name of your Java installation directory and the variable PATH includes the
    <var>bin</var> subdirectory of the Java installation directory. At the time
   of this writing the current POI version was 2.5.1-final dating from August
    4th, 2004. The example statements reflect version numbering and
    date. Change the commands accordingly if you are running the POI Browser of
   a later or earlier than this!</p>

   <div>
    <h4>Running POI Browser on Unix</h4>

    <p>Suppose you have unpacked the POI&nbsp;2.5.1 release in the
     <var>/opt/local/poi</var> directory of your Unix box. Then the following
     command starts the POI Browser and displays the structure of the files
     <var>MyWord.doc</var>, <var>MyExcel.xls</var> and
     <var>MyPowerpoint.ppt</var>:</p>
 
   <pre>java -classpath /opt/local/poi/poi-2.5.1-final-20040804.jar:/opt/local/poi/poi-contrib-2.5.1-final-20040804.jar org.apache.poi.contrib.poibrowser.POIBrowser MyWord.doc MyExcel.xls MyPowerpoint.ppt</pre>
   </div>

   <div>
    <h4>Running POI Browser on Windows</h4>

    <p>Suppose you have unpacked the POI&nbsp;2.5.1 release in the
     <var>C:\Programs\POI</var> directory of your Windows box. Then the following
     command starts the POI Browser and displays the structure of the files
     <var>MyWord.doc</var>, <var>MyExcel.xls</var> and
     <var>MyPowerpoint.ppt</var>:</p>
 
   <pre>java -classpath C:\Programs\POI\poi-2.5.1-final-20040804.jar;C:\Programs\POI\poi-contrib-2.5.1-final-20040804.jar org.apache.poi.contrib.poibrowser.POIBrowser MyWord.doc MyExcel.xls MyPowerpoint.ppt</pre>
