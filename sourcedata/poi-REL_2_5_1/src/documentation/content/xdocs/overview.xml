      <p>The POI project is the master project for developing pure
        Java ports of file formats based on Microsoft's OLE 2 Compound
        Document Format.  OLE 2 Compound Document Format is used by
        Microsoft Office Documents, as well as by programs using MFC
        property sets to serialize their document objects.

      <section><title>POI-Utils</title>
        <p>
          <link href="utils/index.html">POI-Utils</link> are general purpose artifacts
	  from POI development that have not yet been implemented elsewhere.  We're 
          always looking to donate these and maintain them as part of a general library
          used in another project.  These are things we need to complete our mission but
          are generally outside of it.
