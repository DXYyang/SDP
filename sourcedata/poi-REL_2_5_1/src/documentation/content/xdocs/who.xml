 <section><title>Who we are</title>
  <p>
    The Poi Project operates on a meritocracy: the more you do, the more
    responsibility you will obtain. This page lists all of the people who have
    gone the extra mile and are Committers. If you would like to get involved,
    the first step is to join the mailing lists.
  </p>

  <p>
    We ask that you please do not send us emails privately asking for support.
    We are non-paid volunteers who help out with the project and we do not
    necessarily have the time or energy to help people on an individual basis.
    Instead, we have set up mailing lists which often contain hundreds of
    individuals who will help answer detailed requests for help. The benefit of
    using mailing lists over private communication is that it is a shared
    resource where others can also learn from common mistakes and as a
    community we all grow together.
