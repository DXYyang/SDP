            <p>
                Maybe it's unwise to advertise your competitors but we believe
                competition is good and we have the best support reading and
                write Excel workbooks currently available. This however does not
 				purport to be a complete list.

                        This library outputs a simple CSV file, in which cells can
                        contain numbers or text.  You could output a CSV file without its
                        help, but it gives a little more readability/structure to the code, and
                        could be extended to handle more complexity.  When
                        you invoke one of these JSP pages from your browser, you open up an Excel
                        spreadsheet.  There's no formatting, worksheets, or anything fancy like that.
                        So it's not strictly a competitor but it does the job.
