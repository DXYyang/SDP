        <p>
                This section is intended for diagrams (UML/etc) that help
                explain HSSF.

                Have more?  Add a new &quot;bug&quot; to the bug database with [DOCUMENTATION]
                prefacing the description and a link to the file on an http server 
                somewhere.  If you don't have your own webserver, then you can email it
                to (acoliver at apache dot org) provided its &lt; 5MB.  Diagrams should be 
                in some format that can be read at least on Linux and Windows.  Diagrams
                that can be edited are preferrable, but lets face it, there aren't too 
                many good affordable UML tools yet!  And no they don't HAVE to be UML...
                just useful.
