    <section><title>Introduction</title>
       <p>
          A number of people are using POI for a variety of purposes.  As with
          any new API or technology, the first question people generally ask
          is not "how can I" but rather "Who else is doing what I'm about to
          do?"  This is understandable with the abysmal success rate in the
          software business.  These case statements are meant to help create
          confidence and understanding.

    <section><title>Submitting a Case Study</title>
       <p>
          We are actively seeking case studies for this page (after all it
          just started).  Andy Oliver (acoliver at apache dot org) has
          agreed to have a few T-Shirts printed with the POI logo (once its
          chosen) for the first
          few best submissions.  To submit a case study, either
          <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/getinvolved/index.html">
          submit a patch for this page</link> (preferred) or email it to the
          <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/site/mail.html">mailing list
          </link>.

        <p>
          The <link href="http://www.lbank.lt">Bank of Lithuania</link>
          reports financial statistical data to Excel format using the
          <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/poi">Jakarta POI</link>
          project's <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/hssf">
          HSSF</link> API.  The system is based on Oracle JServer and
          utilizes a Java stored procedure that outputs to XLS format
          using the HSSF API.  - Arian Lashkov (alaskov at lbank.lt)

      <section><title>Bit Tracker by Tracker Inc., and ThinkVirtual</title>
        <p>
Bit Tracker (http://www.bittracker.com) is the world's first and only web-based drill bit tracking system to manage your company's critical bit information and use that data to its full potential. It manages all bit related data, including their usage, locations, how they were used, and results such as rate of penetration and dull grade after use.  This data needs to be available in Excel format for backwards compatibility and other uses in the industry.  After using CSV and HTML formats, we needed something better for creating the spreadsheets and POI is the answer.  It works great and was easy to implement.  Kudos to the POI team.

      <section><title>Edwards And Kelcey Technology</title>
      <p>
      Edwards and Kelcey Technology (http://www.ekcorp.com/) developed a
      Facility
      Managament and Maintenance System for the Telecommunications industry
      based
      on Turbine and Velocity. Originally the invoicing was done with a simple
      CVS
      sheet which was then marked up by accounts and customized for each client.
      As growth has been consistent with the application, the requirement for
      invoices that need not be touched by hand increased. POI provided the
      solution to this issue, integrating easily and transparently into the
      system. POI HSSF was used to create the invoices directly from the server
      in
      Excel 97 format and now services over 150 unique invoices per month.

     <section><title>ClickFind</title>
        <p>
          <link href="http://www.clickfind.com">ClickFind Inc.</link> used the POI
          projects HSSF API to provide their medical
          research clients with an Excel export from their electronic data
          collection web service Data Collector 3.0.  The POI team's assistance
          allowed ClickFind to give their clients a data format that requires less
          technical expertise than the XML format used by the Data Collector
          application.  This was important to ClickFind as many of their current
          and potential clients are already using Excel in their day-to-day
          operations and in established procedures for handling their generated
          clinical data.  - Jared Walker (jared.walker at clickfind.com)
