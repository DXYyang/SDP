	<s2 title="Caveats and Limitations">
		<p>This is a list of the limitations in this release of &javaparsername;:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Due to a transcoding bug in the Sun JDK's 
			(1.1.6, 1.1.7, 1.1.8, 1.2)  handling of EBCDIC data 
			(specifically, end of line characters), you must use 
			IBM's JDK 1.1.6, if you want to use EBCDIC support. 
			The IBM JDK has the bug fixed.  We don't know when the 
			bug fix will get into the Sun JDK's. </li>
