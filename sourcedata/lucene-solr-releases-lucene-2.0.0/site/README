Building the website:
---------------------

All you need to do is cd into this directory and type:

    ant

Modifying the website:
----------------------

To modify the website, all you need to do is edit the files in the xdocs 
directory and then rebuild the website. The format of the files is fairly 
straightforward. You should only add XHTML tags because the .xml files 
need to be parsed by an XML parser.

Changing the look and feel of the entire website is easy. Just modify the 
site.vsl file located in the xdocs/stylesheets directory and rebuild.

If you would like to add links to the left side navigation, simply edit 
the project.xml file in the xdocs/stylesheets directory and rebuild.

Place your images in the xdocs/images directory. When you rebuild, the 
modified images will be copied over to the docs/images directory.
