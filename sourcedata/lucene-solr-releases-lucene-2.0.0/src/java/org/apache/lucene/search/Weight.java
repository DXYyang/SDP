/** Expert: Calculate query weights and build query scorers.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of Weight is to make it so that searching does not modify
 * a Query, so that a Query instance can be reused. <br>
 * Searcher dependent state of the query should reside in the Weight. <br>
 * IndexReader dependent state should reside in the Scorer.
 * <p>
 * A <code>Weight</code> is used in the following way:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A <code>Weight</code> is constructed by a top-level query,
 *     given a <code>Searcher</code> ({@link Query#createWeight(Searcher)}).
 * <li>The {@link #sumOfSquaredWeights()} method is called
 *     on the <code>Weight</code> to compute
 *     the query normalization factor {@link Similarity#queryNorm(float)}
 *     of the query clauses contained in the query.
 * <li>The query normalization factor is passed to {@link #normalize(float)}.
 *     At this point the weighting is complete.
 * <li>A <code>Scorer</code> is constructed by {@link #scorer(IndexReader)}.
 * </ol>
