/** IndexReader is an abstract class, providing an interface for accessing an
 index.  Search of an index is done entirely through this abstract interface,
 so that any subclass which implements it is searchable.

 <p> Concrete subclasses of IndexReader are usually constructed with a call to
 one of the static <code>open()</code> methods, e.g. {@link #open(String)}.

 <p> For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via
 <i>document numbers</i>, non-negative integers which each name a unique
 document in the index.  These document numbers are ephemeral--they may change
 as documents are added to and deleted from an index.  Clients should thus not
 rely on a given document having the same number between sessions.
 
 <p> An IndexReader can be opened on a directory for which an IndexWriter is
 opened already, but it cannot be used to delete documents from the index then.
