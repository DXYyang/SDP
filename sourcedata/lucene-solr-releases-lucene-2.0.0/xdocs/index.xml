          <h3>26 May 2006 - Release 2.0.0 available </h3>

             <p>This is mostly a bugfix release from release 1.9.1.
                Note however that deprecated 1.x features have now
                been removed.  Any code that compiles against Lucene
                1.9.1 without deprecation warnings should work without
                further changes with any 2.x release.  For more
                information about this release, please read <a
                href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/tags/lucene_2_0_0/CHANGES.txt">CHANGES.txt</a>.</p>

		<p>Binary and source distributions are
                available <a

          <h3>2 March 2006 - Release 1.9.1 available </h3>

             <p>This fixes a serious bug in release 1.9-final. <a
                href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/tags/lucene_1_9_1/CHANGES.txt">CHANGES.txt</a>

          <h3>27 February 2006 - 1.9 final available </h3>

             <p>This release has many improvements since release
                1.4.3, including new features, performance
                improvements, bug fixes, etc. See <a
                href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/tags/lucene_1_9_final/CHANGES.txt">CHANGES.txt</a>
                for details.</p>

		<p>1.9 will be the last 1.x release.  It is both
                back-compatible with 1.4.3 and forward-compatible with
                the upcoming 2.0 release.  Many methods and classes in
                1.4.3 have been deprecated in 1.9 and will be removed
                in 2.0.  Applications must compile against 1.9 without
                deprecation warnings before they are compatible with
                2.0.</p>

            <p>Monday, December 12, 2005 at 3pm by Grant Ingersoll:<br/>
                Abstract:<br/>
                Lucene is a high performance, scalable, cross-platform search engine that contains many advanced features that often go untapped by the majority of users. In this session, designed for those familiar with Lucene, we will examine some of Lucene's more advanced topics and their application, including:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Term Vectors: Manual and Pseudo relevance feedback; Advanced document collection analysis for
                        domain specialization</li>
                    <li>Span Queries: Better phrase matching; Candidate Identification for Question Answering</li>
                    <li>Tying it all Together: Building a search framework for experimentation and rapid deployment</li>
                    <li>Case Studies from <a href="http://www.cnlp.org">CNLP</a>: Crosslingual/multilingual retrieval in Arabic, English and Dutch;
                        Sublanguage specialization for commercial trouble ticket analysis; Passage retrieval and
                        analysis for Question Answering application</li>                    
                </ol>     
      		<p>Topics 1 through 3 will provide technical details on implementing the advanced Lucene features, while the fourth topic will provide a broader context for understanding when and where to use these features.
            </p>
            
          <h3>14 February 2005 - Lucene moves to Apache top-level</h3>

             <p>Lucene has migrated from Apache's Jakarta project to the top-level.  Along with this migration,
                the source code repository has been converted to Subversion.  The migration is in progress with
                some loose ends.  Please stay tuned!
             </p>
