/**
 * Elements represent most of the "markup" and structure of the
 * document.  They contain both the data for the element itself
 * (element name and attributes), and any contained nodes, including
 * document text (as children).
 * <P>
 * Elements may have Attributes associated with them; the API for this is
 * defined in Node, but the function is implemented here. In general, XML
 * applications should retrive Attributes as Nodes, since they may contain
 * entity references and hence be a fairly complex sub-tree. HTML users will
 * be dealing with simple string values, and convenience methods are provided
 * to work in terms of Strings.
 * <P>
 * DeferredElementImpl inherits from ElementImpl which does not support
 * Namespaces. DeferredElementNSImpl, which inherits from ElementNSImpl, does.
 * @see DeferredElementNSImpl
