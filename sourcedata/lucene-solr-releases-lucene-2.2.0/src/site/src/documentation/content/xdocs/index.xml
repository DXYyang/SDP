            <title>17 February 2007 - Release 2.1 available</title>

            <p>This release has many improvements since release
              2.0, including new features, performance
              improvements, bug fixes, etc. See
              <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/lucene/java/tags/lucene_2_1_0/CHANGES.txt">CHANGES.txt</a>
              for details.
            </p>

            <p>Lucene 2.1 includes index format changes that are not readable
              by older versions of Lucene.  Lucene 2.1 can both read and update
              older Lucene indexes.  Adding to an index with an older format
              will cause it to be converted to the newer format.
            </p>

              available

                <title>26 May 2006 - Release 2.0.0 available</title>

                <p>This is mostly a bugfix release from release 1.9.1.
                    Note however that deprecated 1.x features have now
                    been removed. Any code that compiles against Lucene
                    1.9.1 without deprecation warnings should work without
                    further changes with any 2.x release. For more

                <p>This release has many improvements since release
                    1.4.3, including new features, performance
                    improvements, bug fixes, etc. See

                </p>

                <p>1.9 will be the last 1.x release. It is both
                    back-compatible with 1.4.3 and forward-compatible with
                    the upcoming 2.0 release. Many methods and classes in
                    1.4.3 have been deprecated in 1.9 and will be removed
                    in 2.0. Applications must compile against 1.9 without
                    deprecation warnings before they are compatible with
                    2.0.</p>

                    <br/>
                    Abstract:
                    <br/>
                    Lucene is a high performance, scalable, cross-platform search engine that contains many advanced
                    features that often go untapped by the majority of users. In this session, designed for those
                    familiar with Lucene, we will examine some of Lucene's more advanced topics and their application,
                    including:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Term Vectors: Manual and Pseudo relevance feedback; Advanced document collection analysis for
                        domain specialization</li>
                    <li>Span Queries: Better phrase matching; Candidate Identification for Question Answering</li>
                    <li>Tying it all Together: Building a search framework for experimentation and rapid deployment</li>
                    <li>Case Studies from
                        <a href="http://www.cnlp.org">CNLP</a>
                        : Crosslingual/multilingual retrieval in Arabic, English and Dutch;
                        Sublanguage specialization for commercial trouble ticket analysis; Passage retrieval and
                        analysis for Question Answering application
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Topics 1 through 3 will provide technical details on implementing the advanced Lucene features, while
                    the fourth topic will provide a broader context for understanding when and where to use these
                    features.
                </p>

                <title>14 February 2005 - Lucene moves to Apache top-level</title>

                <p>Lucene has migrated from Apache's Jakarta project to the top-level. Along with this migration,
                    the source code repository has been converted to Subversion. The migration is in progress with
                    some loose ends. Please stay tuned!
