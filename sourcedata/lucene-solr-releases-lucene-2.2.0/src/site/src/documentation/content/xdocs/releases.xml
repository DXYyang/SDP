<p>Information on Lucene Java Downloads and Releases.</p>
    <section id="Official"><title>Official Release</title>
        <p>Official releases are usually created when the <a href="whoweare.html">developers</a> feel there are
            sufficient changes, improvements and bug fixes to warrant a release.
            Due to the voluntary nature of Lucene, no releases are scheduled in advance. System Requirements are detailed
            <a href="systemrequirements.html">here</a>.</p>
			<p>Both binary and source releases are available for 
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/lucene/java/">download from the Apache Mirrors</a></p>
        <p>The lucene-VERSION.zip (where VERSION is the version number of the release, i.e. 2.0.0) file contains the
            lucene-core jar file, html documentation, a demo application (see <a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting Started</a>)
            and various jar files containing contributed code.
            <br/>
             If all you need is the core jar file you can download that separately.
