/** A Token is an occurence of a term from the text of a field.  It consists of
  a term's text, the start and end offset of the term in the text of the field,
  and a type string.
  <p>
  The start and end offsets permit applications to re-associate a token with
  its source text, e.g., to display highlighted query terms in a document
  browser, or to show matching text fragments in a KWIC (KeyWord In Context)
  display, etc.
  <p>
  The type is an interned string, assigned by a lexical analyzer
  (a.k.a. tokenizer), naming the lexical or syntactic class that the token
  belongs to.  For example an end of sentence marker token might be implemented
  with type "eos".  The default token type is "word".  
  <p>
  A Token can optionally have metadata (a.k.a. Payload) in the form of a variable
  length byte array. Use {@link TermPositions#getPayloadLength()} and 
  {@link TermPositions#getPayload(byte[], int)} to retrieve the payloads from the index.

   *
   * <p>The default value is one.
   *
   * <p>Some common uses for this are:<ul>
   *
   * <li>Set it to zero to put multiple terms in the same position.  This is
   * useful if, e.g., a word has multiple stems.  Searches for phrases
   * including either stem will match.  In this case, all but the first stem's
   * increment should be set to zero: the increment of the first instance
   * should be one.  Repeating a token with an increment of zero can also be
   * used to boost the scores of matches on that token.
   *
   * <li>Set it to values greater than one to inhibit exact phrase matches.
   * If, for example, one does not want phrases to match across removed stop
   * words, then one could build a stop word filter that removes stop words and
   * also sets the increment to the number of stop words removed before each
   * non-stop word.  Then exact phrase queries will only match when the terms
   * occur with no intervening stop words.
   *
